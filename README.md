# odin-recipes

This is my first project in HTML and is from The Odin Project's foundation course

This project uses HTML only and is meant to demonstrate my understanding of hyperlinking to other pages on the same site, adding images to a page, using headings correctly, and using different lists.

The index page links to 3 different recipe pages, and each recipe page includes a heading with the recipe's name, an image, a short description of the recipe, an ingredients list, and a list of steps to follow to make the recipe. At the bottom of the page I have included a button that links back to the index page.

I have now added some basic CSS after beginning the CSS Foundations part of the foundations course. Images are centered and scaled appropriately, and I have centered and underlined some titles. I have given some text elements a background colour too.
