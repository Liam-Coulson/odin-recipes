        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Crispy battered fish, chunky chips and homemade tartare sauce, 
            what's not to love? The malty flavour of Doom Bar works brilliantly 
            in the fish batter and complements the dish. Serve with a good squeeze 
            of lemon or vinegar, if you prefer.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>800g Maris Piper potatoes</li>
            <li>approx 500ml sunflower oil, for frying</li>
            <li>4 x 120g fillets white fish, eg hake or haddock</li>
            <li>200g plain flour​</li>
            <li>50g cornflour</li>
            <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>250-300ml Doom Bar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to gas 7, 220°C, fan 200°C. Cut the potatoes 
                (unpeeled) into 1.5-2cm chips. Transfer to a baking tray and 
                toss with 2 tbsp of sunflower oil. Bake in the oven for 45-50 mins 
                until golden and crisp, turning once after 25 mins.​ 
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare the fish. Preheat the oil in a large pan 
                to a medium heat. It's hot when the tip of a wooden spoon bubbles 
                when dipped in the oil, or a thermometer reads 180-190°C.​ 
            </li>
            <li>While the oil is heating, season the fish well. In a large bowl, 
                mix together the flour, cornflour, and baking powder. Slowly whisk 
                in the Doom Bar until you have a thick batter the consistency of very 
                thick cream – you may not need all of the ale.​ ​ 
            </li>
            <li>Dip the fish in the batter and allow the excess to drip off, 
                then drop into the hot oil. Cook for around 3 mins per side until 
                a deep golden colour. Repeat with the remaining fillets.​ 
            </li>
            <li>To make the tartar sauce, mix together all the ingredients, 
                and season to taste. For the samphire, bring a small pan of water 
                to the boil and blanch the samphire for 2-3 mins until just tender. Drain.​ 
            </li>
            <li>Serve the battered fish with the samphire, oven chips, 
                tartar sauce and a wedge of lemon.​ ​
            </li>
        </ol>
